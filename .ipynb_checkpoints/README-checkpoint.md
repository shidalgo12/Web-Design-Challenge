# Web-Design

## Background

A visualization webpage created using Matplotlib scattered plots designed in the Python-API-Challenge (https://github.com/shidalgo12/Python-API-Challenge). Detailed coding used in .html and .css files to structure each webpage and apply bootstrap design features.  

A Landing Page was created to summarize all plots along with links to 6 individual pages accessible through a structured navigation bar.  Each page organized to allow images, text and navigation bars to appear as positioned.
